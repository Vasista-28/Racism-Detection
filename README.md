# Racism Detection
 
Social media opinions and remarks provoking racial differences have been regarded as a serious threat to social, political, and cultural stability and have threatened the peace of different countries. Consequently, social media being the leading source of racist opinions dissemination should be monitored and racism remarks should be detected and blocked timely.

Superior performance of deep learning, a stacked ensemble deep learning model is assembled by combining GRU, CNN, and RNN, called, Gated Convolutional Recurrent- Neural Networks (GCR-NN).
GRU is on the top in the GCR-NN model to extract the suitable and prominent features from raw text, CNN extracts important features for RNN to make accurate predictions. 
As an extension to attain higher accuracy and preciseness we have applied Voting Classifier, LSTM and GRU for analysis of Dataset.
Advantages:
The proposed GCR-NN within the scope of machine learning and deep learning models indicating the superior performance of GCR-NN with increased accuracy.
The proposed Voting Classifier, LSTM model can detect most of the tweets that contain racist comments.
